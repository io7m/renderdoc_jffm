## renderdoc_jffm

A Java interface to the [RenderDoc API](https://renderdoc.org).

## Features

* A friendly Java interface to the RenderDoc API.
* [JPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)-ready.
* ISC license.

## Usage

When running your application, you must allow access to the
[FFM](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) API for the module
`com.io7m.renderdoc_jffm.core`:

```
$ java --enable-native-access=com.io7m.renderdoc_jffm.core ...
```

Run your application from RenderDoc. RenderDoc works by injecting a native
library into your application. Then, inside your application, call
`RenderDoc.open()`:

```
try (final var doc = RenderDoc.open()) {
  ...
}
```

The obtained `RenderDocType` interface is a type-safe, memory-safe interface
to the API exposed by the RenderDoc native library. The interface allows for
setting options and triggering captures.

The `open()` method will raise an `IOException` with a useful error message
if the `renderdoc` native library is not present in the current application
process.
